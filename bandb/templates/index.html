        <h1>Welcome</h1>

        <p>Nestled in the heart of Thomas Hardy country at the foot of Melbury Downs you will find Tilley's Hut. Adjacent to a working farm and at the end of a secluded lane your stay will be truly relaxing and will take you back in time.</p>

        <p><a href="{% url 'hut' %}">The Shepherd's Hut</a> has been completely renovated and dates back to around 1910 when it was used by Shepherds during the lambing season on the Dorset Downs. It has been lovingly restored and is now fully insulated and comfortably furnished.</p>

        <p>In the evenings the hut is heated by a wood burner and lit by solar powered lighting. When you wake, you will find a breakfast hamper full of local produce has been delivered to your door for you to enjoy at your leisure.</p>

        <p>The <a href="{% url 'area' %}">serene and secluded location</a> in Melbury Abbas, North Dorset is a mile away from the Saxon hilltop town of Shaftesbury.</p>

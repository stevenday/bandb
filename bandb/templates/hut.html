        <h1>The Hut</h1>

        <p>Situated on the edge of a field, adjoining a copse of semi-mature trees some fifty yards from the nearest building, is the Hut. You enter the Hut by climbing a short flight of steps to a split stable door. On your left is a small stove which can provide plenty of warmth even on the chilliest of evenings, whilst on your right there is a small dresser and a wardrobe for storage. There is a folding table with shelving space and two chairs by a window which overlooks rolling fields and woodland.</p>
        <p>At the far end of the Hut there is a comfortable bed which is 4 feet wide and 6 feet long and provided with a luxurious duvet and cushions. Should you wish to remain engaged with the 21st century a solar panel will provide adequate energy for lighting, lap tops, and recharging mobile phones etc.</p>

        <p>Tea and coffee making facilities are available in the Hut and we have also provided a barbeque and seating area close to the Hut in order that you can enjoy your stay to the full, but please note that we do not provide a television. <em>We would like to remind you that Tilley's Hut is bed and breakfast accommodation and is not self-catering. Therefore we would kindly request that you do not prepare cooked food in the Hut.</em></p>
